# Agentic Coding — build log

Chronological journal of how this project is built with a piloted team of expert agents. Doubles as a
generalizable draft for LinkedIn/blog articles. Most recent entry **last**.

## 2026-06-20 — M0: bootstrap & governance

- Approved an incremental plan (Lot 1 = public showcase site) after a deep requirements pass.
- Chose a two-ecosystem repo (`frontend/` TS/React/Astro, `backend/` Python skeleton), content as
  YAML decoupled from presentation, EM-first positioning, Cloudflare Pages hosting.
- Scaffolded root governance & tooling: `README.md` + `CLAUDE.md` (`@README.md` import),
  `.claude/settings.json`, `Makefile` (one-liner task runner) + `scripts/` (doctor, init, lint, test,
  deploy, github-bootstrap), `.envrc` (direnv), root `.gitignore`, ADRs (0001–0004) and playbooks.
- Recorded environment gaps surfaced by `make doctor` (uv, gh, pre-commit, direnv, wrangler, …) — to
  be installed per `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
